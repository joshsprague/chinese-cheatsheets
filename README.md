Chinese Cheatsheets
===========
Rapidly build lists for decoding Chinese script. 

This project is built to explore possibilities of [Pearson's Longman English-Chinese Dictionary API](http://developer.pearson.com/apis/longman-dictionary/). While the dictionary is constructed to describe English to Chinese readers, it still offers some potential for English speakers decoding Chinese script.

While on a research trip to China, I found myself making a lot of lists to extend the character lists offered by my phrasebook. Hand writing these lists was useful to learning, but time-consuming. My goal with this project is to craft the fastest option for building customized lists for decoding Chinese.

Practical uses include:

* Menu decoders tailored to personal tastes and dietary restrictions

* Name and direction references for your taxi driver

* Sign and vocab lists customized for unique errands not addressed in general phrasebooks
